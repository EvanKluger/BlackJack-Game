# BlackJack-Game
Hey everyone. 

This is a Black Jack python game that I have worked on for a Portfolio Project for a Codecademy course.

The main.py file is the main game frame that allows a user to play against the dealer. Every hand the User has full customization over how much he/she bets and how every decision is made in the hand. The dealer plays according to official BlackJack rules.

The algo file runs a game where an algorithim that plays "based on the book" and decides how the user should play each scenario. The user has full customization over how much he/she bets every hand, but every decision regarding whether to double, split, hit or stand is decided by the algorithim to maximize the best result according to the odds. 

The data file runs the algorithim against the dealer and returns the data from mutliple hands played decided by the player. The user decides how many hands should be played along with how much should be bet per hand, and the console runs such amount of hands. Afterwards, the console returns a plot displaying how many hands were won by both the dealer and the player along with how much the player profits/loses. 

Feel free to use it and play. Just download the files and run them through a python IDE to play.

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out!
