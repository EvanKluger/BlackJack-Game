# BlackJack-Game
Hey everyone. 

This is a Black Jack python game that I have worked on for a Portfolio Project for a Codecademy course.

The main.py file is the main game frame that allows a user to play against the dealer.

The algo file runs a game where an algorithim that plays "based on the book" runs how the user decides whether to double, split, hit or stand.

The data file runs the algorithim against the dealer and returns the data from mutliple hands played decided by the player.

Feel free to use it and play.

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out!
